/**
 * LLM Agent Prompt Builder (per-thread context)
 * =============================================
 *
 * Builds a system prompt for an LLM agent that drafts outbound emails
 * about a specific case. Pulls together:
 *
 *   - structured case fields (company, customer, status, etc.),
 *   - prior conversation history from the same Slack thread,
 *   - explicit output rules (tone, language, signing block),
 *   - a workflow-state instruction (ask for recipient if unknown,
 *     send via Outlook tool only when user types the trigger word).
 *
 * The pattern: rebuild the system prompt fresh on every invocation.
 * No persistent agent memory, no per-conversation state stored on the
 * agent's side. Everything the agent needs is in this one prompt.
 *
 * Used in: n8n Code node, after the thread context extractor and
 * before the LangChain agent / Azure OpenAI Chat node.
 *
 * Output: { systemPrompt, chatInput, ...passthrough }, the agent
 * node consumes systemPrompt as its system message and chatInput as
 * the user message.
